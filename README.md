# electron-react



## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 7 and an npm version >= 4.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aproximo/React_01test_project_electron.git
```

And then install dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ npm install


## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
